# CBI-fiscal_stance_analysis
Hello! This repository contains an R code for my bachelor's thesis in macroeconomics that explores the relationship between Central Bank Independence (CBI) and fiscal stance

# Structure 

The repository is orgnized as follows: 

1- **Code** folder: contains all R files with the code for the analysis

2- **Data** folder: contains all the Excel files with raw data for the analysis

3- **Output** folder: it is empty now, but it will contain the tables with regression outputs once all the code has been run.
