# Excel Dataset

This folder contains the Excel datasets for analyzing the relationship between Central Bank Independence and fiscal stance. The file is built by downloading the data separately from the IMF and World Bank databases and from Romelli's website (CBI index) and copying them on different worksheets of the same workbook. 

## Files

- `Original Dataset.xlsx` - This file contains all the raw data used in the analysis
- `Original Dataset - bond yield.xlsx` - This file contains all the raw data used in the analysis

## Note 

Both files contain all the data needed for the analysis, but since the code overwrites them by creating a new workbook with all the data rearranged for the analysis (and it does it in both the code scripts separately), I have put two copies of the same file. After running the code, they will become quite different from one another.
