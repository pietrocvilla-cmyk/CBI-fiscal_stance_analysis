# Output Folder

This directory contains the empirical results generated by the R analysis scripts.

⚠️ This folder may be empty when you first download the repository. Output files are automatically generated when you run the analysis scripts in the `code/` folder.

## Contents

This folder stores:
- **Regression tables** (HTML format) showing the relationship between CBI and fiscal outcomes
- **Statistical results** including coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels
- All results use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HC1)
